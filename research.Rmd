# My Research

1. **Identifying Important Risk Factors for Future Mania in Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder Using Weighted Random Forest Models and the NESARC Dataset**  
This is the capstone project for my master's degree. *Here you can find my [presentation slides](library/practicum project/mwPracticum_JialiangHua_final2.pptx) and the [report](library/practicum project/Practicum Report_JialiangHua.pdf).*

2. [**Understanding weights options "proportional" and "outer" in EMMeans**](z_understand_weights_prop_outer_in_emmeans.html)  
In this project, I pioneered research on weights options in Estimated Marginal Means (EMMs), clarifying application practices through empirical testing and mathematical analysis. Additionally, I collaborated with my colleagues at Mental Health Data Science, Columbia University Department of Psychiatry and New York State Psychiatric Institute to test and understand the “type” and “regrid” options in EMMs, and figured out the calculation methods of EMMs from models with link function for `emmeans` function in R, `Genmod lsmeans` and `%margins` macro in SAS. *Here you can find the [presentation slides](library/Adjusted means sharpen-the-axe Dec 6 2023.pptx) and my [code packet](z_understand_weights_prop_outer_in_emmeans.html#mypacket).*
