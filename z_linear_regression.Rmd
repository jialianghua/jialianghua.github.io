- **Sampling**: We wanna do research that makes generalizations or test hypotheses about a large population. But typically we can't get our hands on everyone in the population. So we try to get a random and representative sample.

- **Sampling error**: The difference between the population and the sample. **Standard error** is an estimate of amount of sampling error.

  - SE = SD/Sqrt(N)
  
Descriptive statistics --> inferential statistics

- **Regression**: a statistical analysis used to predict scores on an outcome variable, based on scores on one or multiple predictor variables.

  - Simple regression: one predictor variable 
  
  - Multiple regression: multiple predictors
